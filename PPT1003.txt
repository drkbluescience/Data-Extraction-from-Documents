After talking for so long, why is there a need for regulation in the financial market?
The first reason is that the financial market is becoming increasingly complex. Why is it becoming more complex? Simply put, the variety of financial products in the market is growing! So, would you say the financial market is becoming simpler or more complex? Of course, it is becoming more complex! That's why there is a need for regulation!
The second reason is that the flows of very large amounts of wealth have increased, which requires regulation!
The third reason is the proliferation of malpractices. For example, there are instances of improper sales, coercion, and deception, which necessitate regulation!
