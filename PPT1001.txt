People often say that Hong Kong is an international financial center. Who says that? Is it true just because someone says so? Actually, it is stated in Article 109 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong.
So, what exactly are financial markets? In fact, financial markets serve multiple functions that we should remember. Finance is all about money, so what does it include?
First, if you don't have enough money, you need to get it from others. This process of finding and getting money is called capital raising. Going public also involves raising capital and money. Investing, on the other hand, means giving money to others when you have it. Therefore, you will engage in these two activities depending on regardless of whether you have money or not.
What other functions do financial markets have? They include the facilitation of cash and capital flows, capital and investment protection, hedging, safe custody, security, speculation, insurance, and so on.
